  <div class="biography">
    <h4>Hey! I’m Billy and I’m from Seattle, Washington. I went to the <span id="uw">University of Washington</span> and majored in Public Health. I'm a public health professional and an aspiring developer. Currently, I work at a biotech company that performs innovative cancer testing. Prior to that, I worked at a non-profit HIV clinic. While working in the public health/ biology field, I learned that I am passionate about the wellbeing of our community, but was not fond of the mental turmoil that came with the role. I took a step back and re-evaluated my values surrounding public health. Development came to mind as there are many opportunities for me to contribute to public health while not being in the front lines. Currently, I am in the process of switching careers! Creating apps, webpages, and software for public health is my end goal.

    <br>
    Outside of my career, I enjoy playing competitive video games such as Valorant and TFT. I also enjoy the sport of powerlifting and playing basketball. If you listen to R&B and rap, put me on to some music. :)
